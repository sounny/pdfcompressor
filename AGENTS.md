# AGENTS

This repository hosts a purely client-side PDF compression tool accessible via `index.html`.

## Instructions for Agents
- Treat this file as shared working memory: read it before making changes.
- After you commit changes, append a dated entry under **Working Memory Log** summarizing your ideas, decisions, and modifications.
- Keep entries concise but informative.
- Place new entries at the end of the log.
- Run any available tests or linting commands and note results in the log (currently none defined).
